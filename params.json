Where it goes, volume, mute etc. From the command line.\r\n\r\nThe \"sound\" utility allows you to adjust certain parameters of the Raspbery Pi\r\nsound system. The usage is:\r\n    \r\n        sound a_parameter\r\n    \r\nWhere a_parameter is one of the following:\r\n    \r\n*   AUTO            Sets the sound output to be automatically detected. Normally \r\n                this means that if a monitor or TV is connected to the HDMI \r\n                socket,  the sound will be directed to that device, otherwise, \r\n                it is directed to the headphone socket.\r\n    \r\n*   HDMI            Forces the sound to the HDMI connector.\r\n    \r\n*   HEADPHONES      Forces the sound to the headphone socket. This is \r\n                useful if your HDMI device doesn't have decent \r\n                (or any!) speakers.\r\n    \r\n*   DEVICE          This returns a value that tells you where the current sound \r\n                output is this will be one of \"auto\", \"hdmi\" or \"headphones\".\r\n                   \r\n*   MUTE            Mutes the sound.\r\n    \r\n*   UNMUTE          Unmutes the sound.\r\n    \r\n*   MUTED           This command returns a string \"on\" or \"off\" that tells you the \r\n                current muted state of the sound system. \"muted\" means that \r\n                there is no sound - it has been muted, \"unmuted\" means sound \r\n                should be audible.\r\n                  \r\n*   VOLUME          Returns a number representing the current volume as a \r\n                percentage.\r\n    \r\n*   n%              This command sets the volume to the desired percentage. If this\r\n                is outside of the range 0% to 100% then it will be adjusted to \r\n                remain within the range of valid values. The actual '%' sign is optional.\r\n    \r\n*   HELP            Displays this help text.\r\n    \r\n*   SETTINGS        This command displays the current settings and is equivalent\r\n                to calling DEVICE, MUTED and VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
