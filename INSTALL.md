INSTALLING
----------

The file sound.py is all that is required. The easiest way to install it is as follows:

sudo cp sound.py /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/sound.py
sudo ln /usr/local/bin/sound.py /usr/local/bin/sound

Now it can be executed as follows:

$ sound.py a_parameter

or

$ sound.py a_parameter

Have fun.
